Assignment for CIS 1910 in University of guelph. 
Command-line program written in C that simulates Conwayâ€™s game of life algorithm. Seed data is provided in the form of a pgm image file.
Subsequent passes in the simulation are output to the shell.
Students would maintain internal state simulating a grid of "live" and "dead" cells. At each pass of the simulation, the following rules would be applied to alter program state:

**Rules:**
1 - Live cells bordered by fewer than two live neighbors would die.
2- Live cells bordered by two to three live neighbors would stay alive.
3 -Live cells bordered by more than three live neighbors would die.
4- Dead cells bordered by three live neighbors would become alive.
